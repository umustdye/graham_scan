Graham Scan c++ Implementation 
There is the original version and two optimized versions. For the optimized versions, the preprocessed file, is an implementation of the 
Akl-Toussaint Heuristic. The preprocessed with threshold file is the Akl-Toussaint Heuristic with a threshold so the datasets with a smaller size aren't affected by the heuristic. 
The testing datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZQ6ZTwVKks7J8NMciGHA4cVeYoL-evI?usp=sharing).
